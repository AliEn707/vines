  <p>
    Vines is an XMPP chat server that connects you with large clusters of
    machines as easily as chatting with a friend. It's a new, simpler way to
    manage your servers in the cloud or the data center.

    <h2>Command line++</h2>
    <p>
      We all love the command line, but it's limited to one machine at a time.
      With Vines, we can chat with hundreds of servers at the same time, using
      the shell commands we already know. Need to patch a bunch of development
      servers? Run <em>yum update</em> once and we're done!

    <h2>With great power, comes great responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      Tired of updating sudoers files across all of your servers? Consolidate
      privileges in Vines and give people access to just the accounts they need.
      Developers get access to the apache and mysql accounts on development
      machines. Operations gets full access to production. Not everyone needs the
      responsibility of root.

    <h2>Plays well with others</h2>
    <p>
    Because Vines is based on industry-standard XMPP technology, it works
    seamlessly with your favorite chat clients like iChat,
    <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>. And it's easy to connect custom
    bots to automate chat sessions with hundreds of machines.
