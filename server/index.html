title: Vines - XMPP/Jabber chat server for Ruby
---
<h2>Vines Server Install</h2>
<p>
  These instructions install the basic Vines XMPP server. To install the full Vines
  stack, capable of chatting with servers, refer to the Vines Services
  <a href="/services/">installation guide</a>.
</p>
<pre>
$ gem install vines
$ vines init wonderland.lit
$ cd wonderland.lit &amp;&amp; vines start
</pre>
<p>
  That's all there is to it. No database to setup, no web console to configure.
  Just three commands and we're ready to chat.
</p>
<p>
  The init command creates two example users in the wonderland.lit domain:
  alice@wonderland.lit and arthur@wonderland.lit. Alice and Arthur are on
  each other's buddy lists (or <em>rosters</em> in XMPP terminology) so they
  can chat together as soon as we login with our favorite chat client.
</p>
<p>
  The iChat, <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a>, and
  <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> chat clients are nice to get started
  with because they allow us to specify a chat server host name that's different
  from our wonderland.lit domain, which obviously won't route with the fanciful
  .lit extension. Launch one of those clients and set the server name to
  <em>localhost</em> and the port to <em>5222</em>. To log in, use
  alice@wonderland.lit with password <em>secr3t</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Do this once more with arthur@wonderland.lit, his password is also
  <em>secr3t</em>, and we should see each user online and ready to chat.
</p>
<p>
  This is a good default chat server that works right out of the box, but
  check out the <a href="/server/configure/">config file documentation</a> for
  more customized deployments.
