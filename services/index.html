title: Vines - Services Install

<h2>Vines Services Install</h2>
<p>
  The Vines Services installer creates a Vines chat server, the services
  component, and an agent on the local machine. It also populates CouchDB
  with some initial data. It's a quick way to get all three
  <a href="/docs/">components</a> up and running quickly.
</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>
  Before installing Vines, make sure that <a href="/ruby/">Ruby</a> and CouchDB
  are installed. Apache provides <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB installers</a>
  for several platforms or, on Fedora and Ubuntu, we can install with
  <em>yum install couchdb</em> or <em>apt-get install couchdb</em>.
</p>
<p>
  After installing CouchDB, we can check its web
  management interface at http://localhost:5984/_utils to make sure it's running.
</p>
<h3>Vines Ruby Gems</h3>
<pre>
$ gem install vines vines-agent vines-services
$ vines-services init wonderland.lit
Creating a new chat user account
User ID: alice
Password:
Created user: alice@wonderland.lit
Started vines server: vines start -d
Started vines services component: vines-services start -d
Created user: orchid.local@wonderland.lit
Started vines agent: vines-agent start -d
Initialized server, agent, and services directories: wonderland.lit
Login as alice@wonderland.lit at http://localhost:5280/
</pre>
<p>
  That's all there is to it. Just two commands and we're ready to start using
  Vines.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that the init command created a user account for the local system,
  orchid.local@wonderland.lit. As soon as we login with alice's user name and
  password, we'll be able to chat with our first server.
</p>
<p>
  The web application is a good place to login and get started, but we can also
  use any other XMPP client like iChat, <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a>, and
  <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>. Just use <em>localhost</em> as the
  server name and a port of <em>5222</em>.
</p>
<p>
  With Vines installed and running, check out the overview of the
  <a href="/services/web/">web application</a>.
